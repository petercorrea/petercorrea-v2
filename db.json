  "professionalSummary": [
    "I've worked on a range of notable projects, from in-house billing services and vendor marketplaces to personalization platforms. My work spans mobile apps for a few hundred users to web apps that reach several million across the globe. I've built software for a variety of organizations including a waste management start-up, and at an agency where I worked with major clients like PayPal and Coinbase.",
    "My day-to-day responsibilities normally include deploying full-stack applications, migrating databases, improving developer experiences, writing test cases, and integrating APIs. When I'm not coding, I'm collaborating with designers and stakeholders, presenting to staff, conducting code reviews, interviewing candidates, mentoring peers, and onboarding new team members.",
    "Beyond general software engineering, I occasionally explore areas like cryptography, game theory, embedded systems, machine learning and playing the saxophone."
